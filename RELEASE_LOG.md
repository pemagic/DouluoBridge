### Release Automation
- **Summarized Release Logs**: Implemented automatic extraction of version-specific notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Direct Body Pasting**: Configured GitHub Actions to use `RELEASE_LOG.md` as the source for the Release body, ensuring logs are explicitly "pasted" rather than automatically generated.
